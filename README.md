# AutoPromptX: Interactive Prompt Optimizer for LLM Agents

**AutoPromptX** is a research prototype that demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can automatically optimize user prompts to produce clearer, more accurate, and more useful responses. The project was developed for the AgentX LLM Agents MOOC Competition (Research Track) hosted by Berkeley RDI.

## Overview

AutoPromptX is an interactive web application that enables users to:

* Enter a natural language prompt or question.
* View the initial response generated by a state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., GPT-4o).
* Watch as the LLM critiques its own response and rewrites the prompt for improved clarity, specificity, and completeness.
* Compare the original and optimized responses side by side, with visual highlights of improvements.
* Quantitatively measure enhancements using readability and clarity metrics.

The project explores the potential of LLM agents to perform automated prompt engineering, supporting both research in agent self-improvement and practical development of LLM-driven applications.

## Features

* **Prompt Input:** Users can enter any open-ended query or instruction.
* **Initial Response Generation:** The LLM responds to the user's original prompt.
* **Self-Critique & Prompt Optimization:** The LLM analyzes its own response, critiques it, and rewrites the prompt to make it more effective.
* **Optimized Response Generation:** The LLM generates a new response to the optimized prompt.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Responses are shown side by side, with differences visually highlighted.
* **Metrics Dashboard:** Automated calculation of readability scores and other text quality metrics.

## Demo

**Example Workflow:**

1. **User Prompt:**
   `"Describe how gravity works."`
2. **Initial LLM Response:**
   `Gravity is a force that attracts objects toward each other. It keeps the planets in orbit around the Sun.`
3. **Optimized Prompt (by AutoPromptX):**
   `"Explain how gravity works in simple language, using an analogy that a young student could understand."`
4. **Optimized LLM Response:**
   `Gravity is like an invisible hand that pulls things together. For example, it’s why an apple falls to the ground and why the planets go around the Sun.`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
* [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web UI
* [textstat](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/) for readability metrics

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autopromptx.git
   cd autopromptx
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit openai textstat
   ```

3. **Set your OpenAI API key:**

   * Open `app.py` and replace `"sk-..."` with your actual API key
   * Or, set it as an environment variable:

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
     ```

     (Then modify the code to `openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`)

4. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Research Directions

AutoPromptX is designed as a research tool for:

* Evaluating the effectiveness of LLM self-critique and prompt optimization
* Quantifying improvements in response quality (clarity, completeness, readability)
* Experimenting with multi-turn, human-in-the-loop, or adversarial prompt scenarios
* Serving as a baseline for studies on prompt robustness and AI safety

You are encouraged to extend or adapt the demo for academic or research purposes.
